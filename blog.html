		<ul>
			<li>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you solve them?
				<p> </p>
				<ul>
					<li>The biggest trouble I had was finding the prompt for the assignment actually, I didnt see it on canvas, the course website or on piazza. the assignment 0 link only took me to my empty assignment 0 repository. I ended ul going to other peoples projects to view their readme files which contained the prompt</li>
				</ul></li>
				<p> </p>
			<li>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?
				<p> </p>
				<ul>
					<li>I learned how to use the un-organized lists, I already knew how to use headers and include images.</li>
				</ul></li>
				<p> </p>
			<li>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Piazza forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?
				<p> </p>
				<ul>
					<li>I did not really use any web resources, I used some noted from lecture to remember the tags for the un-organized lists. I just assumed that you could make sublists by embedding a list within a list and that worked out nicely.</li>
				</ul></li>
